# How I made this
1. Window: display the window
2. GamePanel (game loop and update/draw) and KeyInput: get a moving rectangle
3. implement player entity: get a moving player
4. create tile system: create a background for player
5. world/camera: camera centered on player, only seen tiles render
6. add collision detection
7. add objects (door, chest, key) then their interactions
